Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is enough to edit 4k60fps videos but will slow down a bit in 5k60fps! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!\""

       " \"Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did.\",\n",

       " 'I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don\\'t need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \\\\Macbook\\\\\". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/24',\n",

I took it to the service centre and they informed me the mother board and battery collapsed. If it was not in warranty I had to pay 47000/. I asked for replacement of the product and I was refused. They got it fixed for me. I don‚Äôt know why should I pay 57000/ for Mac quality. If this is the quality and the service, then I have to go to other product. In January my product expiry was due.

Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is enough to edit 4k60fps videos but will slow down a bit in 5k60fps! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!\""
